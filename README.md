Python script for theoretical analysis in the paper "High Molecular Conductance and Inverted Conductance Decay over 3 nm in Rigidified, Aminium-Terminated OPVs". 

The trans.py script calculates the transmission through a nanostructure according to the Landauer formula for quantum transport with electrodes in the wide-band-approximation.
